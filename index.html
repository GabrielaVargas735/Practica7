    <h2>Plot</h2>

    <p>In 2067, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Corn is the last viable crop. The world has also regressed 
    into a post-truth society where younger generations are taught ideas such as the Apollo moon missions were faked. Widowed engineer
    and former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom Cooper,
    and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy "Murph" Cooper. After a dust storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably appear on Murphy's bedroom 
    floor; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces the patterns were caused by gravity variations and that they
    are a binary code for geographic coordinates. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, 
    Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened elsewhere. 48 years earlier, unknown beings 
    positioned a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a black 
    hole named Gargantua. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts Miller, Edmunds, 
    and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. 
    Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel colonies into space, while Plan B involves launching 
    the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet.
